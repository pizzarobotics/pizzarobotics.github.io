Sandwich is a small ROS-based robot built over a Jetson Nano and a Raspberry PI PICO, to learn, experiment, and test vision algorithms.
Its small form factor makes it possible to work in small environments, without too many size restrictions, and it is built with modular mechanical components, easy to improve and expand. The electronic system is also based on a versatile board to ease the development of any improvements.
Sandwich can be remotely operated, with a custom web-based interface with easy controls and a live camera stream, or can autonomously follow objects or people that it detects with object detection algorithm.
